      <description>Hello World This is my first blog and I want to express something I learned in my graduate year. CMU is a very great place and I could meet many clever and hard-working students in this place. I learn the latest technology and skills in this school, and I also gain many precious experiences here.
Spend time wisely I believe I have a good time management skill and I could handle 4 courses in CMU in one semester.</description>
