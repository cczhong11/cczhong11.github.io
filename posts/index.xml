      <description>Piazza and Slack integration Slack is very popular in the workspace. As a TA in Cloud Computing Course (15-619), we also use Slack to discuss with each other and solve student&amp;rsquo;s problem together. Piazza is another common tool we used every day. It is like a forum within the course.
When a student asks a question, we want to answer them quickly. Piazza could send you new questions in real time with email.</description>

      <description>Deep Neural Networks Neural Networks In general, neural networks have lots of node and each node will perform a transformation. In the easiest way, a linear transmission could be viewed as $\sum w_i x_i$. It is the hard bias for this neural network, it is how each neuron could do. Neural Networks are also built as a layered Feedforward network, and the hard bias is the topology and activation function, they represent the expressive power for the network.</description>

      <description>Scenario Apache Samza is a stream processing framework developed by Linkedin. It allows we to build stateful applications that process data in real-time and it could read data from Apache Kafka smoothly. It has handful of examples on how to read stream data from Kafka topic. However, it did not include any working examples for Apache Samza to consume static data and stream data at the same time in stream processing.</description>

      <description>Virtual IoT Device on Cloud IoT is very hot in these days. I believe in the future, all the devices in the home will have some connections with the internet. We could easily get the stream data from these devices and do some analysis to find the trend or abnormal event. Thanks for 5G and IPV6, it is possible to have enough addresses and high speed network.
There are some key skills that are required in the companies.</description>

      <description>How to use apple script with Omnifocus Omnifocus is a very great to-do list app in Mac and iPhone. It is expensive and very good to use. We could also use apple script to make it become more powerful.
List all done tasks In many cases, we need to do summary on how many tasks we have done that day or week. Therefore, we could just log out all completed tasks and send to notebook/Day one.</description>

      <description>Hack Midwest &amp;ndash; Team Sonder We won Sprint Prize and Cloudinary Prize.
Sonder is a proximity-based multi-purpose private network with applications in home automation, event planning and anonymous communication, enabled through text-based (SMS) virtual assistant. It allows user to anonymously interact with authorized peers.
The problem is every virtual automation assistance needs wifi to communicate with each other, we want to make a AP-less virtual automation. The main idea is to use cellular services to interact with a central hub to process information in areas such as home/office, social gatherings and hackathons.</description>

      <description>The idea It is popular for students to practise their coding skills on leetcode.com. It offers very good questions and good articles. However, it is not easy for people to learn from other good answers. Although it provides discussion, but people needs to go through threads by threads to find the right answers. I want to build a website for myself to find questions easily.
All codes are belong to Leetcode.</description>

      <description>Problem I met a NoSuchMethodError in Azure Java SDK. The error message is like the following:
Exception in thread &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.microsoft.azure.credentials.ApplicationTokenCredentials.proxy()Ljava/net/Proxy;  It was very strange and I searched on the stackoverflow. And it shows the problem could be confliction in package version. Therefore I looked into the code to find the reason.
Solution In the beginning, I needed to go into the source code to see what happened there.</description>

      <description>Create a thumbnail of photo using Java Why we need a thumbnail In the mobile application, if we want to show a picture quickly and we do not care the clarity of that image. We could create a thumbnail of that image, which is a smaller version of this image. The original image captured by iPhone X could be 10 MB, but the thumbnail only have 50 kb, which is much more handy to use when you need to show them quickly.</description>

      <description>Spring boot Framework Spring boot framework is a strong framework helps you build a MVC model web service quickly. So in the first place, we need to understand what is MVC model
Model-View-Controller  Model  Model represent knowledge. It represents how basic items interact with each other.
 Views  A view is a (visual) representation of its model. A view is attached to its model (or model part) and gets the data necessary for the presentation from the model by asking questions.</description>

      <description>Basic Drawing We could use Graphviz to draw a graph in code and it is also easily to used in Markdown file. In this blog, I will focus on dot tool.
In the beginning, we need to install it. If you are a Mac user, we could use brew install graphvis. For other user, you could download file from the official website.
You could create a file with the following code.</description>

      <title>Scala join RDD tips</title>
      <link>http://www.tczhong.com/posts/cc/scala-spark-join/</link>

      <guid>http://www.tczhong.com/posts/cc/scala-spark-join/</guid>
      <description>Why Spark RDD join is expensive As we know, Join is the most expensive operation on rdd. The reason is when we join two rdd, it requires corresponding keys from each RDD are located at the same partition so that they can be combined locally. Therefore, we will shuffle keys from each rdd to make sure they are in the same partition.
You could learn more about rdd join from here</description>

      <description>Tips on improving reading performance In some scenario, we need to have high RPS in HBase reading.Therefore, we could change some configuration in HBase to meet this requirement. I found this blog very helpful. HBase official guide is also great.
 Increase hfile.block.cache.size and decrease hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size. The first configuration is for reading cache and the second one is writing cache. The sum of two value should be 0.8 Decrease BLOCKSIZE in HBase table.</description>

      <description>Introduction Mapreduce is a very strong computing framework and we could use it to transform data to HDFS. Acutally, we could use Mapreduce to write data to any databse.
Basic input and output The key thing in Mapreduce is Mapper and Reducer. We use the following code snippets to build a mapper. Here, Mapper&amp;lt;Object, Text, Text, Text&amp;gt; means input key and value class and ouput key and value class. Please notice that we could not use string and int here, since it is not fit the requirement in HDFS.</description>

      <description>GCP is very cheap compared with AWS and Azure. However, it did not have enough documentation and I met some problems that did not even on StackOverflow. That&amp;rsquo;s why I want to write this blog.
Start your cluster We could use command line with GCP CLI to start cluster.
gcloud dataproc clusters create cluster-name --project=project-id --bucket outputbucket --initialization-actions gs://xxx/jupyter.sh --master-machine-type=n1-standard-2 --worker-machine-type=n1-standard-1 --zone=xxxx  Install external Python package on Spark If we want to use your own package and Juypter NoteBook on Spark, you need to contain an initialization step for your cluster.</description>

      <description>K Nearest Neighbor, K-Means and EM algorithm These three algorithms are used for clustering. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) first.
K Nearest Neighbor Example of k-NN classification. The test sample (green circle) should be classified either to the first class of blue squares or to the second class of red triangles. If k = 3 (solid line circle) it is assigned to the second class because there are 2 triangles and only 1 square inside the inner circle.</description>

      <description>Decision tree This is an important algorithm in Machine Learning field. Using Decision tree can express all possible functions among the data. Understanding decision tree requires us to know entropy in the first place.
Entropy Consider we flip an unbiased coin, we can get head and tail both in 50% chance. But if we flip a biased coin, we can get head in 90% chance and tail 10% chance. It is the most possible to have a head instead of a tail.</description>

      <description>Maximum Likelihood Estimation This is a very basic algorithm but I still want to write a blog about it. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the basic idea.
Probability If we have a situation $S_1$ and event A may happen. For example, under the same situation, the event A happen 7 out of 10. We could see the frequency of event A is 0.7. Under a lot of experiment with the same situation, if we still get the same result, we could see the probability of event A in this situation is 0.</description>
