        <div class="post_content markdown"><h1 id="maximum-likelihood-estimation">Maximum Likelihood Estimation</h1>
<p>This is a fundamental algorithm, but I still want to write a blog about it. Let&rsquo;s start with the basic idea.</p>
<h2 id="probability">Probability</h2>
<p>If we have a situation $S_1$ and event A may happen. For example, under the same situation, the event A happens 7 out of 10. We could see the frequency of event A is 0.7. Under much experiment with the same situation, if we still get the same result, we could see the probability of event A in this situation is 0.7.</p>
<p>Another important concept is the conditional probability. If we have another event B, and B may happen when event A happened. For instance, under the same situation, event B happens 8 out of 10 when event A happened. The frequency of event B when event A happen is 0.8. If event B had the same pattern all the time, we could see the conditional probability of event B when event A happened is $P(B|A)=0.8$, the probability of event A and event B happened at the same time is $P(A, B)$.</p>
<p>Independence is also important to know here. If event A and event B are independent with each other, which means, event A happened or not had nothing to do with the event B, we could get the P(A，B) = P(A)*P(B).</p>
<h2 id="bayes-theorem">Bayes&rsquo; theorem</h2>
<p>It is the most important theorem in the statistics world.</p>
<p>$$P ( A | B ) = \frac { P ( B | A ) P ( A ) } { P ( B ) }$$</p>
<p>If we want to know the probability of the A conditional on B, we can use the probability of the B conditional on A and probability of A and B to know. In the real world, the probability of the A conditional on B is often hard to get, and it can tell us the probability of a reason given situation. We can quickly get the probability of a situation given the reason. The situation A is mostly data. The reason B is mostly hypothesis.</p>
<p>Prior is an important concept in Bayes&rsquo; thinking. It captures the belief for the right answer before seeing the data. In uniform distribution, prior is $\pi(h) = 1/|H|π(h)=1/∣H∣$ if h in H. Here $P(A)$ can be prior</p>
<p>The posterior is the probability of reason after seeing the data. It is $p(A|B)$.</p>
<p>The likelihood is another important concept. It will tell you under the given the parameters, what is the probability for data, expressing as $L(B|A)$.</p>
<p>So in Bayes&rsquo; theorem, we can express it as prior * likelihood/evidence. Evidence is $P(B)$.</p>
<h2 id="maximum-a-posteriori-and-maximum-likelihood-estimation">Maximum A Posteriori and Maximum Likelihood Estimation</h2>
<p>From the Bayes rule, we know $$P(\theta|X)=\frac{P(X|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(X)}$$.</p>
<p>Because $P(X)$ is the same, we could omit this value. $P(\theta|X) \propto P(X|\theta)P(\theta)$.</p>
<p>If we want to find the most likely $\theta$, we need to have $\theta_{ MAP }=\underset{\theta} {\arg\max} P(X|\theta)   P(\theta)$ .</p>
<p>If data point is independent, we can use $\underset{\theta}{\arg\max}\log \prod _ { i } P (x _ {i} |\theta)P(\theta)$ to calculate the result. To make it easier to calculate, we use log in most cases. It is called as Maximum A Posteriori.</p>
<p>For Maximum Likelihood Estimation, we want to maximize the likelihood function, which is $P(X|\theta)$. We want to know which theta could result in the given data.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}\theta _ {MLE} &amp;= \underset{\theta}{\arg\max}P(X|\theta)=\underset{\theta}{\arg\max}\prod _ {i}P\left(x _ {i}|\theta\right)\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The difference between MLE and MAP is $P(\theta)$, if all possible reasons we need to consider is the same, MLE is equal to MAP.</p>
<h2 id="naive-bayes">Naive Bayes</h2>
<p>Naive Bayes is the extension for MAP algorithm. We could use $$j_{NB} = argmax_j p(cat=j)\prod p(a_i|j)$$ to calculate the most possible labels for the given data.</p>
<p>In the text field, we could assume the probability for the given label is based on the frequency of labels in the whole dataset. Then using the frequency of $a_i$ in the given label to calculate $P(a_i|j)$</p>
<p>Sometimes, if there is no data under some labels in the training data, we need to use Laplace smoothing, adding 1 to both fraction side. $$P(w|c)=\frac{\operatorname{count}(w,c)+1}{\operatorname{count}(c)+|V|}$$</p>
