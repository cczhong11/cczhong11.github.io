<p>This is my first blog and I want to express something I learned in my graduate year. CMU is a very great place and I could meet many clever and hard-working students in this place. I learn the latest technology and skills in this school, and I also gain many precious experiences here.</p>
<h2 id="spend-time-wisely">Spend time wisely</h2>
<p>I believe I have a good time management skill and I could handle 4 courses in CMU in one semester. However, I still find I did not spend time efficiently and sometimes I just wasted my time.</p>
<p>We need to write a lot of codes in CMU and it really requires me to think carefully when I run the code. In the past, I have a bad habit that I will run the program to test my code. Sometimes it will occur complie error because of my typo. These mistakes should be elimated before I run the code. I spent serval hours debugging some codes looks like right but having some impossible errors. <strong>Reading codes line by line really is a must when we debug the code</strong>.</p>
<p>Having an <strong>aim</strong> is very important when we need to do anything. If we do not think of what I expect to do in the first place, I believe you will not achieve your goal easily. When I begin to do something, think about what I what to achieve in the first place. Then I will focus on it for the whole time. After finishing it, check the result and my expectation. This is a very ideal flow, however it is not easy to implement in my daily life.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-want-to-start-the-blog">Why I want to start the blog</h2>
<p>In the past, I learned a lot from others&rsquo; tech blog. Other people experience really help me learn new stuff and let me understand some difficult concept. I did not think it is necessary for me to open a blog because I did not have anything to write about. I could find answer easily by searching google.</p>
<p>However, I always want to open a blog to share my experience and learning. It would be great if I could share my learning with the world. Therefore I used Hugo and github.io open a self blog website.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-will-share-here">What I will share here</h2>
<ul>
<li>program learning</li>
<li>cloud and distributed system learning</li>
<li>Algorithm learning</li>
