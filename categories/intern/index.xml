      <description>TimeZone&amp;rsquo;s Problem In my intern project, I need to handle timezone problem. Because in US, there is Daylight time saving and 5 diffferent timezone. My code should provide service for people in different timezones. Therefore, in the front end, I could allow user input time in their own timezone, but I should save date and time in GMT+0. Then I could make sure all time in database is saved in the same timezone.</description>
