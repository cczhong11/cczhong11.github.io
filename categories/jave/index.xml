      <description>Create a thumbnail of photo using Java Why we need a thumbnail In the mobile application, if we want to show a picture quickly and we do not care the clarity of that image. We could create a thumbnail of that image, which is a smaller version of this image. The original image captured by iPhone X could be 10 MB, but the thumbnail only have 50 kb, which is much more handy to use when you need to show them quickly.</description>
