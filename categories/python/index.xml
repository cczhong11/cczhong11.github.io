      <description>Piazza and Slack integration Slack is very popular in the workspace. As a TA in Cloud Computing Course (15-619), we also use Slack to discuss with each other and solve student&amp;rsquo;s problem together. Piazza is another common tool we used every day. It is like a forum within the course.
When a student asks a question, we want to answer them quickly. Piazza could send you new questions in real time with email.</description>
