      <description>The idea It is popular for students to practise their coding skills on leetcode.com. It offers very good questions and good articles. However, it is not easy for people to learn from other good answers. Although it provides discussion, but people needs to go through threads by threads to find the right answers. I want to build a website for myself to find questions easily.
All codes are belong to Leetcode.</description>
